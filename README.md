# Stroop

The .Rmd file in this directory generates the html file that can be found [here](http://darrenabramson.github.io/Stroop/Analysis.html). It contains a statistical analysis of a 24 subject Stroop experiment. 

The only additional resource I used was Stroop's [own 1935 paper](http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Stroop/?c=002).
